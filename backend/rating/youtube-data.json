It handles the view layer for web and mobile apps and also allows developers to create reusable UI components. React is the most popular front-end JavaScript library in the field of web development. It is used by large, established companies and newly-minted startups alike (Netflix, Airbnb, Instagram, and the New York Times, to name a few). React brings many advantages to the table, making it a better choice than other frameworks like Angular.js.\n\nAbout Simplilearn ReactJS training course:\nPuzzled about React.js and how it differs from other JavaScript frameworks? Simplilearn’s online training course on React.js will give you a firm base on how React enables developers to master user interface developing skills with ease. This course will enable you to build React.js applications using React router, data flow and usage with react, bootstrap and CSS, and React middleware.\n\nWhat is the focus of this course?\nSimplilearn’s React.js course is specifically framed for web developers to enhance their web developing skills. Learn how React is different than other JavaScript frameworks, because it is not really a framework. React is actually mainly a view layer, which is beneficial for use in teams and promotes well-organized code. The main focus of this course then involves aiding you to build simple components and integrating them into more complex design components. Gradually, you will be able to implement components, manage data, handle events, apply routing and much more.  Componentized UI is the future of web development, and learning React.js now will ensure your skills remain relevant in this fast-changing industry.\n\nWhat are the course objectives?\nAfter completing this course, you will get a head start to work with React.js productively and gain the following:\n- Acquire hands-on knowledge on basic React components and apply them\n- Code a React with online Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like an expert\n- Manage data by using State and Props of React\n- Learn how to handle events\n- Execute React’s robust router\n- Use flux to augment features of a React app\n- Implement Bootstrap and CSS to style a React app\n- Understand React and how it fits into your web developing process\n\nLearn more at: https://www.simplilearn.com/react-js-certification-training-course?utm_campaign=ReactJS-Basics-Y6aYx_KKM7A&utm_medium=Tutorials&utm_source=youtube\n\nFor more updates on courses and tips follow us on:\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Simplilearn \n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/simplilearn \n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/simplilearn\n- Website: https://www.simplilearn.com\n\nGet the Android app: http://bit.ly/1WlVo4u\nGet the iOS app: http://apple.co/1HIO5J0",

It can be anything from animated graphics to an automatically generated Facebook timeline. When most people get interested in web development, they start with good old HTML and CSS. From there, they move on to JavaScript, which makes sense, because, these three elements together form the backbone of web development. HTML is the structure of your page like the headers, the body text, any images you want to include. It basically defines the contents of a web page.\n\nAbout Full Stack Web Developer - MEAN Stack Course:\nThis program will advance your career as a MEAN stack developer. You’ll learn top skills such as MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js (“MEAN”), plus GIT, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build and deploy interactive applications and services. This Full Stack MEAN Developer program provides complete knowledge of software development and testing technologies such as JavaScript, Node.js, Angular, Docker, and Protractor. You'll build an end-to-end application, test and deploy code, and store data using MongoDB.\n\nKey Features:\n✅ Comprehensive Blended Learning program\n✅ 270 hours of in-depth training\n✅ 150 hours of instructor-led training\n✅120 hours of self-paced learning\n✅ 20 + in-demand tools and skills\n✅ 10 lesson-end & 4 phase-end projects\n✅Choose from 4 industry-aligned capstone projects\n\nIntroduction to ReactJS\nReact JS is an open-source JavaScript library that helps in building dynamic user interfaces for one-page applications. It handles the view layer for web and mobile apps and also allows developers to create reusable UI components. React is the most popular front-end JavaScript library in the field of web development. It is used by large, established companies and newly-minted startups alike (Netflix, Airbnb, Instagram, and the New York Times, to name a few). \n\nAbout Simplilearn ReactJS training course:\nPuzzled about React.js and how it differs from other JavaScript frameworks? Simplilearn’s online training course on React.js will give you a firm base on how React enables developers to master user interface developing skills with ease. This course will enable you to build React.js applications using React router, data flow and usage with react, bootstrap and CSS, and React middleware.\n\nKey Features:\n✅ Comprehensive Blended Learning program\n✅ 270 hours of in-depth training\n✅ 150 hours of instructor-led training\n✅120 hours of self-paced learning\n✅ 20 + in-demand tools and skills\n✅ 10 lesson-end & 4 phase-end projects\n✅Choose from 4 industry-aligned capstone projects\n\n👉Learn more at: https://www.simplilearn.com/full-stack-web-developer-mean-stack-certification-training?utm_campaign=JSandRJSFC&utm_medium=Description&utm_source=youtube\n\n👉Learn more at: https://www.simplilearn.com/react-js-certification-training-course?utm_campaign=JSandRJSFC&utm_medium=Description&utm_source=youtube\n\nFor more information about Simplilearn’s courses, visit: \n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Simplilearn \n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/simplilearn \n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/simplilearn/\n- Website: https://www.simplilearn.com \n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/simplilearn_elearning\n- Telegram Mobile: https://t.me/simplilearnupdates\n- Telegram Desktop: https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=@simplilearnupdates\n\nGet the Simplilearn app: https://simpli.app.link/OlbFAhqMqgb",

It handles the view layer for web and mobile apps and also allows developers to create reusable UI components. React is the most popular front-end JavaScript library in the field of web development. It is used by large, established companies and newly-minted startups alike (Netflix, Airbnb, Instagram, and the New York Times, to name a few). \n\nAbout Simplilearn ReactJS training course:\nPuzzled about React.js and how it differs from other JavaScript frameworks? Simplilearn’s online training course on React.js will give you a firm base on how React enables developers to master user interface developing skills with ease. This course will enable you to build React.js applications using React router, data flow and usage with react, bootstrap and CSS, and React middleware.\n\nWhat is the focus of this course?\nSimplilearn’s React.js course is specifically framed for web developers to enhance their web developing skills. Learn how React is different from other JavaScript frameworks because it is not really a framework. React is actually mainly a view layer, which is beneficial for use in teams and promotes a well-organized code. The main focus of this course then involves aiding you to build simple components and integrating them into more complex design components. Gradually, you will be able to implement components, manage data, handle events, apply to routes, and much more.  Componentized UI is the future of web development, and learning React.js now will ensure your skills remain relevant in this fast-changing industry.\n\nWhat are the course objectives?\nAfter completing this course, you will get a head start to work with React.js productively and gain the following:\n- Acquire hands-on knowledge on basic React components and apply them\n- Code a React with online Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like an expert\n- Manage data by using State and Props of React\n- Learn how to handle events\n- Execute React’s robust router\n- Use flux to augment features of a React app\n- Implement Bootstrap and CSS to style a React app\n- Understand React and how it fits into your web developing process\n\n👉Learn more at: https://www.simplilearn.com/react-js-certification-training-course?referrer=search&tag=reactjs?utm_campaign=React&utm_medium=Description&utm_source=youtube\n\nFor more updates on courses and tips follow us on:\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Simplilearn \n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/simplilearn \n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/simplilearn\n- Website: https://www.simplilearn.com\n\nGet the Android app: http://bit.ly/1WlVo4u\nGet the iOS app: http://apple.co/1HIO5J0",
